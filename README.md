# Gen-AI Project

Welcome to the Gen-AI project! This project leverages Streamlit and the OpenAI API to create a powerful generative artificial intelligence application. The combination of Streamlit's user-friendly interface and OpenAI's advanced language model allows users to interact with and generate creative and context-aware text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- streamlit
## Features

- **Streamlit Interface:** The project utilizes Streamlit for creating a user-friendly and interactive web interface.
  
- **OpenAI API Integration:** The OpenAI API powers the generative capabilities of the application, allowing users to generate creative and contextually relevant text.

- **Customization:** Explore different prompts and parameters to tailor the generated content according to your preferences.


## Acknowledgments
